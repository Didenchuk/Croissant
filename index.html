    <h1>A croissant</h1> 
 <p>
     is a buttery, flaky, French viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough. <br>
      Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape, the dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, <br> then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. 
      <br> The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.
